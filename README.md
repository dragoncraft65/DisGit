# DisGit
A discord bot that allows you to custom host a git style experience, has questionable security so only recommended if your really bored or really don't wanna learn actual git.

# Setup

<p> Clone repository, add in a file with your bots token named token.txt, run the bot and it should work.  <br> Recommended to be put on a seperate drive or not an important computer due to the nonexistant security. </p> <br

# Change Log <br>
v0.1- Just a really basic discord bot as of now  <br>
v0.2- Can be used to make fake repos but can't actually store anything yet <br>
